#Telegram - twitter like app built with Ember CLI

Tools I use:
```
Tool: Ember-cli
Operating System: Virtualbox Ubuntu 64bit
```

First time user registers at '/' URL. <br>
It requires name, username, email, and password <br>

User can login at '/login'. <br>
User enters username and password. <br>
App checks if the user's input matches the one in the model. <br>
If matched, redirect to '/posts' URL. <br>
